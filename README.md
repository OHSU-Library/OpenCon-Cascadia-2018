Vision and mission:
We believe that everyone has the right to access research and scholarship.  We're convening OpenCon Cascadia to provide support to communities and projects with the goal of making scholaship more open, inclusive, and accessible. Are you involved in a project with a goal of improving research, academic culture, or public access to scholarly work? Are you pushing for open research at your institution or organization? Are you involved in a project that seeks to make research more accessible through citizen science or DIY science? 

Join us at OpenCon Cascadia to share stories, discuss challenges, and connect with regional colleagues in a fun and welcoming evniornment. We'll discuss issues facing research and scholarhip today and work on strategy and communication docs for our projects.
